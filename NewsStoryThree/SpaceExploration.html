                         The US, although boasting about how they are going to become the first nation to go to space, ended up losing the race when the Soviet Union successfully launched the first Earth orbiting satellite in history called Sputnik 1 back in october 4 1957. 
                         Only a month after launching Sputnik 1, the Soviet Union launched their second satellite named Sputnik 2, the inside carrying a dog named Laika.
                          As a result the Union becomes the first nation to send a living organism into space, completely defeating the US in the race. </a> </div>

                          After their Successful launch in January the US established the National Aeronautics and Space Administration also known as NASA on october 1 1958.
                           Only two months following the establishment of NASA, the very first communications satellite(SCORE) in the world was launched.
                            It grabbed the world's attention as a Christmas broadcast by the US president Dwight D. Eisenhower was pre-recorded and sent up to orbit, becoming the first human broadcast in space. </a> </div>

                          Even with the successful launch and return of the chimpanzee, the US was once again beaten by the Soviet Union by achieving a monumental task of sending the very first human into space on april 12 1961.
                           Yuri Gagarin boarded the Vostok 1 and proceeded to make a single orbit around Earth becoming the very first man in space.
                            Only a few weeks after the soviets launch did the US respond by sending the first American by the name of Alan Shepard into space.
                             However Shepard did not orbit Earth, rather simply flying 116 miles up and staying in space for only 15 minutes compared to the one hour and forty-eight minute orbit by Yuri Gagarin, showing a glaring difference in the technological advancement between the two nations. </a> </div>

        <p class="text">The first man on the moon. 
            The US had set their sights on a new endeavor having already lost the race to the Soviet Union, becoming the first nation to reach space.
             Following their loss the US had to do something or they would be seen as inferior to the USSR in terms of technological advancement. 
             The constant fear of being seen as a “weaker” nation led to a new goal set by the US, to send the first man to the moon. 
             A man by the name of Neil Armstrong became the first man to set foot on the moon on July 20th 1969. 
             Armstrong followed this achievement by saying the famous line “one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind”.</p>

        <p class="text">The first landing on another planet dates back to 1970, when the soviet union launched the Soviet Venera missions in an attempt to record data from our neighboring planet venus. 
            Although the mission was successful, the results were not what the Soviets expected.
             A harsh environment inhabitable by humans and technology alike, as the spacecraft could only stay on the surface for one hour before having to return. 
             Although these findings highlighted the harsh reality that space had to offer, it was still a big step in human technology.  </p>
