          Humans have long been enfatuated with the thought og space exploration, going beyond to reach heights no one has ever reached.
          In this vastness of space, many nations has tried and failed in reaching these unimaginable heights.
          A Journey to envail what is out there and prove that humans are meant for more than to live and die on earth.
          To reach the stars and find what is yet unseen. We do this to leave a mark on this world and show our existence to all that come after us.
          Join us on our journey, as we show how humans have evolved through trials and tribulations. 
          From simply reaching our outer stratoshper, to going beyond what the naked eye can see and out to the unknown.

          <p>
            The US had set their sights on a new endeavor having already lost
            the space race to the Soviet Union, becoming the first nation to
            reach the moon. The constant fear of being seen as an inferior
            nation in terms of technology, led to a new goal set by the US, to
            send the first man to the moon. A man by the name of Neil Armstrong
            became the first man to set foot on the moon on July 20th 1969...

          <h2>1970</h2>
          <p>
            The first landing on another planet dates back to 1970, when the
            soviet union launched the Soviet Venera missions in an attempt to
            record data from our neighboring planet venus. Although the mission
            was successful, the results were not what the Soviets expected. A
            harsh environment inhabitable by humans and technology alike, as the
            spacecraft could only stay on the surface for one hour before having
            to return. Although these findings highlighted the harsh reality
            that space had to offer, it was still a big step in human
            technology.

          <h2>1977</h2>
          <p>
            In 1977 the US launched voyager 1 and two in an effort to explore
            deeper into the vastness of space, voyager 1 in particular is still
            going to this day, exploring deeper and deeper into space until its
            mission finally comes to an end. The satellites were sent towards
            Jupiter and Saturn to explore their surfaces, yet the satellites
            managed to find volcanoes on Jupiter's moon and new discoveries on
            saturn's rings. The biggest take away from this mission was by far
            how technology from over 40 years(voyager 1) has had a leading role
            in helping us discover far into space even today.

          <h2>1996</h2>
          <p>
            On December 4th in 1996 the US Launched the spacecraft named Delta
            II towards mars in hopes of exploring its surface. The mars
            pathfinder first made landfall 7 months after the initial launch,
            becoming the first manmade object to reach the planet. The
            Pathfinders mission was to analyze the Martian surface, its
            atmosphere, the climate and geology. The findings suggested that at
            one point the planet had flowing water, which may have been signs of
            life for the planet, furthering the belief that we are not alone in
            the vastness of space.

          <h2>2020s</h2>
          <p>
            Inhabiting Mars has long been the goal for us humans. It is seen as
            the pinnacle of human achievement in our goal to reach the next
            level of civilization. There are many things needed for this goal to
            be possible, yet communication might be the biggest factor in the
            long run. There will be no knowing how smoothly things are going and
            whether or not we can send more people to mars without a stable
            communication network. But these points don't even take into
            consideration how long it would take to get to mars and back. It
            would take up to 850 days just to get to mars and back, leaving the
            question, who is willing to take the risk?, as Being the first also
            means being a “test subject” for future people to use as an
            example...

          There is still a lot we don't know when it comes to our universe, most
          of our ignorance comes from our inability to fully explore our
          surroundings. It is unexplainable how little we know, yet a quote from
          1927 said by a man named Arthur Eddington better explained the mystery
          of our universe, than we ever could “The universe is not only stranger
          than we imagine, it is stranger than we can imagine”. No matter how
          much we think we know there is still so much unknown and unexplored.
          Rather than saying, “we might never fully know what's out there” it is
          more appropriate to say that we will never fully know what's out
          there. As the universe is ever expanding, so is our thirst for
          knowledge and neither will ever reach its end.
