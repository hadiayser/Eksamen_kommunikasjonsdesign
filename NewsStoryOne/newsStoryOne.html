          crossroads, grappling with the profound impact of the conflict on its
          population. The long-anticipated All-Union Census of 1959 shed light
          on a nation scarred by war, yet resolute in its efforts to rebuild and

          complied 'The Stalingrad Protocols', which are interviews with
          previous Soviet soldiers who lived and experienced the ravaging

          life on the Eastern Front.

          8.7 million of those lost were military personnel, and the remaining
          were 19 million innocent civilians, people not involved in the
          cruelties of WW2. The battle of Stalingrad stands as a horrifying
          example of the personal and individual tragedies that unfolded across
          the Eastern Front.

          As the bloody Battle of Stalingrad drew to a close on the last day of
          January 1943, the death toll was estimated to be 1.2 million people.
          1.1 million of the casualties were Soviets, whereas 100.000 were
          Germans. 'The Stalingrad Protocols', include an astonishing number of
          first-hand interviews by Red Army soldiers. One of those interviewed,
          Vasily Zaytsev, who was the Red Army's top sniper, and claimed to have
          shot dead 242 Germans, said, «You often have to remember, and memory
          has a powerful impact,» he recalled one year after the battle, before
          the term PTSD had been invented, "Now I have unsteady nerves and I'm
          constantly shaking.".

        <h3>16 Million Lives: Soviet Union's Post-War Landscape</h3>
        <p>
          According to an article published in Foreign Affairs, "Soviet
          Population Today" in July 1959, written by Warren W. Eason, the
          devastating toll of the Second World War manifested in a significant
          decline in the Soviet population. By 1950, the nation witnessed a
          staggering decrease of almost 15.5 million individuals, marking an
          eight percent reduction from the pre-war levels of 1940.
        </p>
      </div> -->
      <div class="scrollText">
        <!-- <p>
          The largest Soviet state, Russia (RSFSR), bore the brunt of this
          decline, accounting for almost nine million fewer people, reflecting
          an identical eight percent decrease. It was a somber reality, and the
          journey to pre-war population levels was not swift; it took until
          1955, a decade after the conflict had ceased.
        </p> -->
        These records are a testament to the resilience and sacrifice of a
        nation. As we remember the 75 million lives lost globally in WW2, the
        interviews from Stalingrad soldiers reminds us that each and every
        statistic represents individuals of a generation forever marked by the
        horrifying and profound cost of war.
