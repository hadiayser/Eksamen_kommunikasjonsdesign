          <!-- In the aftermath of World War II, the Soviet Union found itself at a
          crossroads, grappling with the profound impact of the conflict on its
          population. The long-anticipated All-Union Census of 1959 shed light
          on a nation scarred by war, yet resolute in its efforts to rebuild and
          transform. -->
          The estimated number of casualties in WW2 vary, but the most suggeste
          number is that 75 million people died, 20 million military personnel,
          and 40 million civilians.

        According to a dataset from Statista about urban and rural populations of the Soviet Union in 1940 to 1955,
          The amount of citizens in the USSR in 1940 was 194.07 million people.
          in 1950 it was 178 million peopleâ€¦ 16 million lives were gone in the
          span of a decade.

        <h3>16 Million Lives: Soviet Union's Post-War Landscape</h3>
        <p>
          According to an article published in Foreign Affairs, "Soviet Population Today" in July 1959, written by Warren W. Eason,
          the devastating toll of the Second World War manifested in a
          significant decline in the Soviet population. By 1950, the nation
          witnessed a staggering decrease of almost 15.5 million individuals,
          marking an eight percent reduction from the pre-war levels of 1940.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="scrollText">
        <p>The largest Soviet state, Russia (RSFSR), bore the brunt of this
            decline, accounting for almost nine million fewer people, reflecting
            an identical eight percent decrease. It was a somber reality, and the
            journey to pre-war population levels was not swift; it took until
            1955, a decade after the conflict had ceased.</p>
