        <p>
          Norway is looked up as a socially inclusive nation — a bastion of
          progressiveness, equality, wealth and human rights. This is all true,
          yet behind this image, hides a dark shadow with sharp claws burrowed
          deep, a reality: the continuous presence of racial prejudice. On the
          surface, Norway projects and image of a society in harmony, a country
          of breathtaking fjords and emerald-green forests that echo with tales
          of inclusivity and acceptance. Often portrayed as a progressive and
          perfect utopia because of its strong social welfare system, its
          approach to environmental challenges, and continues involvement in
          international peacekeeping missions. However, like everything else,
          peeling back the layers reveals discrimination, racism, inequality and
          more.(probs change later)

        <h2><i>The Landscape of Racism in Norway </i></h2>
        <p>
          According to numbers from Statistisk sentralbyrå/Statistics Norway
          (SSB) (ha med link her) one in four immigrants experienced
          discrimination because of their ethnic background. Compared to the
          general population, immigrants faced a much higher rate of prejudice
          in the past year. Compared to 19% of the general population, 50% of
          Norwegians born to immigrant parents and 40% of immigrants have faced
          discrimination. Nearly one in four immigrants report having
          encountered discrimination based on their ethnic heritage in the last
          year. Additionally, 12% of respondents claim to have experienced
          discrimination due to their skin tone, and 7% cite their religion or
          way of life as the reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at these numbers highlights how awfully common racist
          discrimination is in Norway, and it puts into perspective just how
          many people are affected, friends, family or yourself even. Most of
          those who experience racist discrimination can move past it, but
          that's not the case for everyone, most hauntingly Benjamin Hermansen,
          a young boy, only 15 years of age, who in 2001, whose life was
          violently and disgustingly taken away by two self-proclaimed nazis
          whose only goal was to murder innocents people solely based on the
          colour of their skin. (endre på senere)

        <h2>Benjamin Hermansen: The Symbolic Figure</h2>
        <p>
          Delving into the life of Benjamin Hermansen, we unravel a narrative
          that encapsulates the profound impact of racism in Norway. Benjamin
          born to a Ghanian father and a Norwegian mother in 1985, reflected the
          multicultural fabric that Norway was becoming. Benjamin was raised in
          Oslo, more specifically the neighbourhood of Holmlia. Benjamin
          embodied diversity and served as a symbol of the country's changing
          identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tragically, at the young age of 15, Benjamin Hermansen life was cut
          short. The circumstances surrounding his murder in 2001 were fuelled
          by an unsettling manifestation of neo-Nazi ideology. Benjamin and his
          friend were on their way home late at night. Then a car with the
          assailants –– Joe Erling Jahr, Ole Nicolai Kvisle and Veronica
          Andreassen, stops right beside them. According to this news article
          from
          <a
            href="https://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/i/J117bX/bestevennen-saa-benjamin-bli-drept"
            >VG</a
          >
          ,this is how the conversation between Benjamin and his friend went. -
          “Are you thinking the same as me” Benjamin asked his friend. – “Yes,
          neo-nazis”, his friend answered back. The friends split up, and that
          was when Benjamin was attacked and fatally stabbed the assailants
          driven by racial hatred. This horrific act of violence shocked the
          nation to its core and exposed the terrible reality that people of
          diverse backgrounds experience. (skrive mer senere?)
        </p>
        <p>
          We turn to those who knew Benjamin Hermansen the best –– his friends,
          family and members of his community. – “Benjamin died as a hero, don’t
          think about him like a victim,” his best friend Victor Lopez said.
          Hermansen’s family, grappling with the unimaginable loss brought on by
          racial prejudice shared their grief and the enduring pain. Friends
          spoke about special times spent with him, praising his integrity,
          generosity, and potential. The community also echoed a sense of shared
          grief and resolve to face the ghost of prejudice that had taken one of
          their own lives. A personal perspective emerges, painting a clear
          image of a young man with dreams, aspirations and an unbreakable
          spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following Benjamin Hermansen’s murder, there was a significant shift
          in the national conversation around racism in Norway. The shockwaves
          from this tragedy reverberated across the nation, prompting
          introspection and a collective call to action. The incident laid bare
          a hard reality by exposing racial prejudices that had previously been
          hidden beneath the surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          Benjamin Hermansen’s passing served as a catalyst for change, igniting
          projects, discussions, and a heightened consciousness of the
          pernicious effects of racism. His passing mobilized individuals to
          work towards creating a more inclusive and tolerant society.
          Hermansen's passing turned him into a symbol, a person whose legacy
          serves as a stark reminder of the pressing need for social reflection,
          dialogue, and the dismantling of systems that uphold racial injustice.

        <h2>A Call to Action and Initiatives</h2>
        <p>
          In the wake of Benjamin Hermansen's tragic murder in 2001, Norway
          witnessed a surge of initiatives aimed at addressing the deep-seated
          issues of racism and discrimination within the nation. An important
          initiative that gained traction was greater emphasis on cultural
          diversity education. A price called “Benjaminprisen” was created, this
          is a school price that gets handed out each year to the school that
          works best to educate and make its students aware of racism and
          discrimination. Norway has demonstrated a resolute commitment to
          transforming its narrative and fostering an environment where
          diversity is embraced rather than marginalized.

        <h2>Conclusion: Toward a More Inclusive Future</h2>
        <p>
          Retracing the moving course of Benjamin Hermansen’s life and
          tragically untimely death, Norway finds itself at a turning point –– a
          crossroads where it must embrace its past and pave the way for an
          inclusive future. The legacy of Hermansen is not confined to the
          annals of history; rather, it continues to resonate as a forceful
          exhortation to contemplation and significant transformation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The efforts that have arisen post-Hermansen represent a collective
          response to confront and dismantle structures rooted in prejudice The
          increased focus on cultural education, laws against hate crimes, and
          community-led awareness initiatives are intentional steps toward
          creating a society in which diversity is valued rather than shunned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, the journey is far from over. The tale of Benjamin Hermansen
          serves as a catalyst for change and a constant reminder that the fight
          against racism is ongoing. It takes a persistent commitment to
          envision a more inclusive future—a dedication that transcends laws and
          penetrates the very fabric of society.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this ongoing narrative, conversation turns into a potent catalyst
          for understanding. Informed by a shared commitment, discussions
          regarding race and identity the threads weaving a tapestry of
          inclusivity. The legacy of Benjamin Hermansen is not only a sobering
          lesson, but also a beacon of hope, steering Norway in the direction of
          a future in which each person can flourish in an environment of true
          equality.

          Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
          industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever
          since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
          scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only
          five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
          remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with
          the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and
          more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
          including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
