        <h2><i>Introduction: Setting the Stage</i></h2>
        <p>
          Norway is looked up as a socially inclusive nation — a bastion of
          progressiveness, equality, wealth and human rights. This is all true,
          yet behind this image, hides a dark shadow with sharp claws burrowed
          deep, a reality: the continuous presence of racial prejudice. On the
          surface, Norway projects and image of a society in harmony, a country
          of breathtaking fjords and emerald-green forests that echo with tales
          of inclusivity and acceptance. Often portrayed as a progressive and
          perfect utopia because of its strong social welfare system, its
          approach to environmental challenges, and continues involvement in
          international peacekeeping missions. However, like everything else,
          peeling back the layers reveals discrimination, racism, inequality and
          more.

        <h2><i>The Landscape of Racism in Norway </i></h2>
        <p>
          According to numbers from Statistisk sentralbyrå/Statistics Norway
          (SSB) (ha med link her) one in four immigrants experienced
          discrimination because of their ethnic background. Compared to the
          general population, immigrants faced a much higher rate of prejudice
          in the past year. Compared to 19% of the general population, 50% of
          Norwegians born to immigrant parents and 40% of immigrants have faced
          discrimination. Nearly one in four immigrants report having
          encountered discrimination based on their ethnic heritage in the last
          year. Additionally, 12% of respondents claim to have experienced
          discrimination due to their skin tone, and 7% cite their religion or
          way of life as the reason.

        This chart helps us see how common racism is in our society among
        different groups of people. The chart draws attention to the startlingly
        high rates at which people have experienced racism on the basis of their
        religion, race, or ethnicity. Significant obstacles are faced by
        immigrants, as evidenced by the 24.2% of those who describe encounters
        with ethnicity, 12.2% with skin color, and 7.1% with religion. The
        percentages for the Norwegian-born students with immigrant parents are
        31.3%, 24.4%, and 15.6%, respectively, indicating that their challenges
        are still present. The chart also shows the need for more public
        awareness, since even in the general population, 1.3%, 1%, and 1% of
        respondents say they have experienced prejudice because of their
        religion, race, or ethnicity, respectively. These percentages highlight
        how urgent it is to create a society that is really inclusive and free
        from discriminatory attitudes and behaviors.

          Looking at these numbers highlights how awfully common racist
          discrimination is in Norway, and it puts into perspective just how
          many people are affected, friends, family or yourself even. Most of
          those who experience racist discrimination can move past it, but
          that's not the case for everyone, most hauntingly Benjamin Hermansen,
          a young boy, only 15 years of age, who in 2001, whose life was
          violently and disgustingly taken away by two self-proclaimed nazis
          whose only goal was to murder innocents people solely based on the
          colour of their skin.

        <h2>Benjamin Hermansen: The Symbolic Figure</h2>
        <p>
          Delving into the life of Benjamin Hermansen, we unravel a narrative
          that encapsulates the profound impact of racism in Norway. Benjamin
          born to a Ghanian father and a Norwegian mother in 1985, reflected the
          multicultural fabric that Norway was becoming. Benjamin was raised in
          Oslo, more specifically the neighbourhood of Holmlia. Benjamin
          embodied diversity and served as a symbol of the country's changing
          identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tragically, at the young age of 15, Benjamin Hermansen life was cut
          short. The circumstances surrounding his murder in 2001 were fuelled
          by an unsettling manifestation of neo-Nazi ideology. Benjamin and his
          friend were on their way home late at night. Then a car with the
          assailants — Joe Erling Jahr, Ole Nicolai Kvisle and Veronica
          Andreassen, stops right beside them. According to this news article
          from
          <a
            href="https://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/i/J117bX/bestevennen-saa-benjamin-bli-drept"
            style="color: red"
            >VG</a
          >
          ,this is how the conversation between Benjamin and his friend went. -
          “Are you thinking the same as me” Benjamin asked his friend. — “Yes,
          neo-nazis”, his friend answered back. The friends split up, and that
          was when Benjamin was attacked and fatally stabbed the assailants
          driven by racial hatred. This horrific act of violence shocked the
          nation to its core and exposed the terrible reality that people of
          diverse backgrounds experience. (skrive mer senere?)
        </p>
        <p>
          We turn to those who knew Benjamin Hermansen the best — his friends,
          family and members of his community. — “Benjamin died as a hero, don't
          think about him like a victim,” his best friend Victor Lopez said.
          Hermansen's family, grappling with the unimaginable loss brought on by
          racial prejudice shared their grief and the enduring pain. Friends
          spoke about special times spent with him, praising his integrity,
          generosity, and potential. The community also echoed a sense of shared
          grief and resolve to face the ghost of prejudice that had taken one of
          their own lives. A personal perspective emerges, painting a clear
          image of a young man with dreams, aspirations and an unbreakable
          spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following Benjamin Hermansen's murder, there was a significant shift
          in the national conversation around racism in Norway. The shockwaves
          from this tragedy reverberated across the nation, prompting
          introspection and a collective call to action. The incident laid bare
          a hard reality by exposing racial prejudices that had previously been
          hidden beneath the surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          Benjamin Hermansen's passing served as a catalyst for change, igniting
          projects, discussions, and a heightened consciousness of the
          pernicious effects of racism. His passing mobilized individuals to
          work towards creating a more inclusive and tolerant society.
          Hermansen's passing turned him into a symbol, a person whose legacy
          serves as a stark reminder of the pressing need for social reflection,
          dialogue, and the dismantling of systems that uphold racial injustice.

        <h2>Students Speak Out: Racism In The Educating System</h2>
        <p>
          For this news story, I, Hadi Ayser Ali, decided to interview two
          student I know who have experienced racism in the classroom before.
          Both our students wanted to remain anonymous, so with their permission
          we decided to use the names “Ahmed” and “Richie” respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ahmed shared with us a troubling incident of racism he encountered
          with one of his teachers in high school. Ahmed recalled a grading exam
          that went well until the teacher, who was very impressed with Ahmed's
          English proficiency, and asked where Ahmed has learned to speak
          English so well. Ahmed answered by saying, “I lived in Kenya for 12
          years, that's where I learnt”. The conversation took an unexpected
          turn when the teacher immediately assumed that Ahmed had lived in a
          refugee camp. Ahmed clarified that he had lived in a house, and
          emphasizing to me that, " all the students from a minority background
          had to work twice as hard to get a grade the same or even lower as the
          other student.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Ahmed stressed that educational institutions perform more thorough
          background checks on those they hire, and he emphasized the value of
          instructors keeping an open mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Richie, the other student I interviewed, talked about her experience
          with racism with their social studies teacher in high school. Richie,
          who has done exceptionally well in their social studies class, felt
          singled out because of their foreign sounding last name. Richie
          related an instance in which the teacher called her derogatory terms
          like "ape". Richie's grades in this class were negatively impacted by
          this harassment, and even though Richie's grades were consistently
          high during the semester, the social studies teacher ultimately gave
          Richie a much lower grade on the rapport card than was deserved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Richie asks that people avoid voicing racist opinions and stressed the
          importance of having an open mind.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content2">
        <h2>A Call to Action and Initiatives</h2>
        <p>
          Benjamin Hermansen's tragic murder is an example of where the cruelest
          and most extremt thoughts and actions of racism and discrimination can
          led to. Norway witnessed a surge of initiatives aimed at addressing
          the deep-seated issues of racism and discrimination within the nation.
          An important initiative that gained traction was greater emphasis on
          cultural diversity education.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the milder side we have students like "Ahmed" and "Richie", who
          have experienced racism and or discrimination in educational
          institutions. These are often remarks or comments given by teachers,
          but as we see, they often go beyond, and try to put less value, or
          ruin a student's grades.
        </p>
        <p>
          Expreiences like this are unfortunately a too often of an occurrence,
          but to Norway's credit the nation and its people have demonstrated a
          resolute commitment to transforming its narrative and fostering an
          environment where diversity is embraced rather than marginalized

        <h2>Conclusion: Toward a More Inclusive Future</h2>
        <p>
          Yet, the journey is far from over. The tale of Benjamin Hermansen
          serves as a catalyst for change and a constant reminder that the fight
          against racism is ongoing. It takes a persistent commitment to
          envision a more inclusive future—a dedication that transcends laws and
          penetrates the very fabric of society.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this ongoing narrative, conversation turns into a potent catalyst
          for understanding. Informed by a shared commitment, discussions
          regarding race and identity the threads weaving a tapestry of
          inclusivity. The legacy of Benjamin Hermansen, and the experiences of
          students like Ahmed and Richie is a lesson for the nation, steering
          Norway in the direction of a future in which each person can flourish
          in an environment of true equality.
