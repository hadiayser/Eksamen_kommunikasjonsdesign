                Norway, traditionally with lower adolescent cannabis use compared to many European counterparts, witnessed a peak in the early 2000s followed by a decline. However, recent data from the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD) and the Ungdata survey hint at a resurgence in cannabis use, reaching approximately 9% among adolescents in 2019. Notably, this increase is echoed in higher education students, signaling a concerning trend that requires further exploration.

          The chart above illustrates key trends in cannabis usage among Norwegian youth, shedding light on crucial turning points over the years.
          <br>
          <br>
          The chart underlines a significant spike in cannabis usage, nearly reaching a 50% increase in 1999. This period marked a notable shift in the relationship between Norwegian youth and cannabis.
          <br>
          <br>
          Contrary to the surge in 1999, there was a consistent decline in usage percentages from 1999 to 2011. Despite stringent regulations and presumed preventive measures, the data indicates a steady decrease in cannabis consumption during this period.
          <br>
          <br>
          However, the trend took an unexpected turn from 2011 to 2019, witnessing a 40% increase in cannabis usage. This shift poses questions about the effectiveness of existing preventive measures and the factors contributing to this resurgence.

        <h2> Gender Disparities </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Analyses across time and regions reveal nuanced patterns. 
            Historically, adolescent boys tend to report higher cannabis use,
             with potential gender gaps narrowing in recent times. Additionally,
              variations in cannabis use emerge between urban and rural areas, 
              adding complexity to the understanding of the issue. It's crucial to explore 
              these dynamics to tailor preventive measures effectively.

        <h2>Interview with a Teen: Understanding the Impact</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          To provide a firsthand perspective, we spoke with Damien, a 22-year-old student from Oslo. They shared insights into the factors contributing to the rise in cannabis use among Norwegian teens.
          <br>
          <br>
         <h4>Damien's Insights:</h4>
<br>
<p>
  "I think one major factor to this is that it is being more commonly talked about 
  & not as looked down upon. For example: TikTok has a trend where people post videos 
  of them having fun while high," Damien noted when asked about the increase in cannabis use.
<br> <br>
"Most of my friends haven't ever taken a puff while others who you'd think wouldn't ever do weed
 need a whole joint to get high," Damien added, shedding light on the varied experiences within 
 their peer group.
<br> <br>
"Weed was demonized, and I've seen people claim it to having killed people.
 The attitude today towards weed is like 'we need to have someone roll a joint for the party 
 tonight.' It's like alcohol, just a milder and safer version," Damien shared regarding the evolving
  attitudes towards cannabis.

          <h2>Implications For Norway's Youth 
          </h2>
          <br>
      <p>
        As cannabis use among Norwegian adolescents rises,
         concerns about the effectiveness of existing preventive measures are growing.
          Damien's insights underline the shifting cultural landscape surrounding cannabis.
           The acknowledgment that cannabis is becoming more normalized, particularly through 
           platforms like TikTok, provides a crucial context.
           <br>
           <br>
        Experts emphasize the necessity for a comprehensive investigation into age-group-specific,
         gender-specific, and location-specific data to inform targeted interventions and policies.
          The concurrent rise in cannabis use among Norwegian adolescents, alongside global trends,
           raises critical questions about the effectiveness of existing preventive measures.
            The need for a comprehensive investigation into age-group-specific, gender-specific,
             and location-specific data is evident to inform targeted interventions and policies.
              Damien's perspective adds a human dimension to these concerns, 
              emphasizing the importance of considering individual experiences in shaping effective preventive measures.

        <h2>Conclusion : What does this all mean?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          In conclusion, as we navigate the surge in cannabis use among Norwegian teens, insights from individuals like Damien shed light on the evolving landscape. Damien's observations about the changing perceptions, influenced by social media trends and shifting attitudes, provide valuable context. The data from ESPAD and Ungdata surveys underscore the urgency for tailored interventions. As cannabis continues to exert its influence both globally and locally, addressing this issue requires a comprehensive strategy that adapts to the dynamic nature of cannabis use among the youth. The call for a deeper understanding, coupled with targeted measures, is crucial in shaping effective preventive measures for the challenges posed by the rising trend.
