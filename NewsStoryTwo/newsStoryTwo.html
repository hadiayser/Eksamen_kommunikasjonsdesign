                Every 20 years or so the earth experiences great changes globally in surface temperature.
                 In the years leading up to the 2020s, the heat energy generated from 1950s-2020s was so massive that it increased the earth surface temperature by roughly 2,2 degrees fahrenheit or 1,1 degrees celsius.
                  In only 40 years(1980-2020) the earth's temperature had risen by a staggering 0.8 degrees celsius in a span of only 40 years.
                   Although it doesn't seem like much, this change causes great environmental changes.
                    There are countless floods and the seawater is rising.
                     The average sea water level has risen by 21-24 centimeters since 1880(source-2) and in only the year 2020 was there recorded 201 major floods across the globe(source-3).
                      This major shift has been caused by the great changes in the global surface temperature.
