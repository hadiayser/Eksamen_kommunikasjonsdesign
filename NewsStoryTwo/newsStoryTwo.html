        <H2 style="font-size: 2rem;">Cannabis, commonly known as marijuana, is a versatile plant that has been utilized

             Its primarily known for its psychoactive properties,
              it contains compounds like THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) and CBD (cannabidiol) that interact 
              with the human brain, resulting in altered perceptions and mood changes. Cannabis is the most widely used illicit dug

        <h2>The Global Crisis:</h2>
        <p>
          This rising tide is not a distant threat but a present reality. In
          2022, the global mean sea level reached 101.2 millimeters (4 inches)
          above 1993 levels, the highest in the satellite record. The culprit is
          a combination of melting glaciers and ice sheets, coupled with the
          expansion of seawater as it warms. The annual rise has surged from the
          20th-century average of 0.06 inches (1.4 millimeters) to 0.14 inches
          (3.6 millimeters) per year from 2006–2015.

        <h2>Endangered Cities:</h2>
        <p>
          From Miami to Mumbai, cities across the globe are grappling with the
          impending crisis. Miami, with its glittering skyline, is witnessing a
          relentless encroachment of seawater into its streets.¨ In Asia,
          megacities like Bangkok and Shanghai are racing against time to
          fortify against the rising tide. If the world fails to meet the carbon
          emission reduction targets of the Paris Agreement, over 800 million
          people in 570 cities could face the extraordinary threat of rising
          seas by 2050. The economic toll could amount to a staggering $1
          trillion by mid-century. East coast cities in the U.S., like New York
          and Miami, are particularly vulnerable, experiencing sea level rise
          two to three times faster than the global average. The vulnerability
          of these cities isn't just an environmental concern but a
          socio-economic challenge, threatening millions with displacement.

        <h2>Amsterdam in Peril:</h2>
        <p>
          Nestled in the heart of Europe, Amsterdam, with its intricate canal
          system, is not immune to the encroaching waters. The Royal Netherlands
          Meteorological Institute (KNMI) warns of increased risks, projecting
          more frequent storms and heavier rainfall. The city's rich history of
          battling water now faces an unprecedented challenge that puts its very
          essence at stake. Amid this global crisis, Amsterdam's fate hangs in
          the balance. Since 1900, sea levels near the Dutch coast have risen by
          19 cm, mirroring the global average. However, recent decades have seen
          an alarming acceleration to 3 mm per year, a 50% increase from the
          20th-century average. Projections by the Royal Netherlands
          Meteorological Institute paint a daunting picture, with estimates of a
          rise between 25 to 80 cm by 2071-2100.

        <h2>The Call to Action:</h2>
        <p>
          The Dutch, masters of water management, are responding with
          innovation. The Maeslant storm surge barrier, a marvel of engineering,
          stands guard against floods in Rotterdam. Built with rising sea levels
          in mind, it can withstand an increase of five meters. However,
          innovation is the new frontier. In Rotterdam, the world's first
          Floating Farm offers a glimpse of a climate-adaptive future, less
          dependent on traditional logistics. As the world watches, this idea
          has sparked interest in cities like Singapore and Dubai.
