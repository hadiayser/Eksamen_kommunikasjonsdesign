                    Recent findings from prominent surveys highlight a concerning resurgence in cannabis use among Norwegian adolescents, reversing a trend of decline observed since the early 2000s. According to data from the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD) and the Ungdata survey, approximately 9% of Norwegian youths reported cannabis use in 2019, signaling a notable uptick. This rise is particularly pronounced among higher education students, prompting a closer examination of the evolving landscape of cannabis consumption in Norway.

        <h2>Cannabis in Norway </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Norway, traditionally with lower adolescent cannabis use compared to many European counterparts, witnessed a peak in the early 2000s followed by a decline. However, recent data from the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD) and the Ungdata survey hint at a resurgence in cannabis use, reaching approximately 9% among adolescents in 2019. Notably, this increase is echoed in higher education students, signaling a concerning trend that requires further exploration.

          This visual representation underscores the magnitude of the increase and provides a clear snapshot of how much cannabis is being consumed by the surveyed youths.
           It shows how many have used cannabis sometimes, within the last twelve months and the last 30 days through said survey.
            The chart holds a lot of interesting points that may give us some insight as to what kind of relationship the Norwegian youth of the late 1990s had with cannabis.
             The most significant increase in usage of cannabis came in 1999, where there was almost a 50% increase in usage across the board among the Norwegian youth.
              Although we assume this was taken action against as the most notable aspect of the chart is the steady decrease in usage percentage from 1999-2011. 
              Despite these drastic changes and strict laws, the use of cannabis is yet again on the rise as there has been a 40% increase from 2011-2019.

        <h2> Gender Disparities </h2>
        <p>
            Analyses across time and regions reveal nuanced patterns. Historically, adolescent boys tend to report higher cannabis use, with potential gender gaps narrowing in recent times. Additionally, variations in cannabis use emerge between urban and rural areas, adding complexity to the understanding of the issue. It's crucial to explore these dynamics to tailor preventive measures effectively.

        <h2>Implications For Norway’s Youth 
        </h2>
    <p>
        The concurrent rise in cannabis use among Norwegian adolescents, alongside global trends, raises critical questions about the effectiveness of existing preventive measures. The need for a comprehensive investigation into age-group-specific, gender-specific, and location-specific data is evident to inform targeted interventions and policies.
